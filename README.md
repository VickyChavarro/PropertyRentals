- The project centred on the development of a loan management system for the corporation 'La Casa de Mis Sueños', which specialises in the online rental of properties. The objective of the project was to maintain detailed control of the loans that affiliated banks make to clients wishing to rent properties. 

- The system was implemented utilising a relational model that incorporated the primary tables of banks, debtors, loans and credits, with defined relationships to manage the interactions between these entities.

- The development process commenced with the creation of the tables, which were designed to meet the integrity requirements and constraints of the business. Primary and foreign keys were established to ensure data consistency, and specific constraints were included such as the impossibility of nulls and validation of data types in critical fields. 

- The implementation of SQL queries in the form of views was instrumental in extracting key information from the system, thereby facilitating effective decision-making and operational control. These views not only facilitated the visualisation of information in a structured way, but also enabled the identification of patterns and trends in financial and debtor data.

- The project culminated in the delivery of a SQL script containing all the necessary instructions for the creation of the database schema, the insertion of data and the generation of the requested views. Suitable permissions were established for querying the tables and views, thus satisfying the course delivery requirements. The system was designed to not only facilitate the internal control of loans and credits, but also to provide a robust tool for the financial and operational management of the banks associated with 'La Casa de Mis Sueños'.
