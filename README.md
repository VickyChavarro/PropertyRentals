- The project centred on the development of a loan management system for the corporation 'La Casa de Mis Sueños', which specialises in the online rental of properties. The objective of the project was to maintain detailed control of the loans that affiliated banks make to clients wishing to rent properties. 

- The system was implemented using a relational model that incorporated the primary tables of banks, debtors, loans and credits, with defined relationships to manage the interactions between these entities.

- The development process started with creating the tables. These were designed to meet the business's integrity requirements and constraints. Primary and foreign keys were created to make sure the data was consistent, and specific rules were added such as the fact that nulls were not allowed and data types had to be validated in important fields. 

- The use of SQL queries in the form of views was very important in getting key information from the system. This made it easier to make good decisions and control how things were done. They also made it easy to see information in a clear way, and they also let us spot patterns and trends in financial and debtor data.
  
- The project finsished in the delivery of a SQL script with all the necessary instructions for the creation of the database schema, the insertion of data and the generation of the requested views. Suitable permissions were established for querying the tables and views, thus satisfying the course delivery requirements. The system was designed to not only facilitate the internal control of loans and credits, but also to provide a robust tool for the financial and operational management of the banks associated with 'La Casa de Mis Sueños'.
